/// A function which creates a new [Client] by wrapping a [Client].
///
/// You can extend the functions of a [Client] by wrapping it in [Middleware]
/// that can intercept and process a HTTP request before it it sent to a
/// client, a response after it is received by a client, or both.
///
/// Because [Middleware] consumes a [Client] and returns a new [Client],
/// multiple [Middleware] instances can be composed together to offer rich
/// functionality.
///
/// Common uses for middleware include caching, logging, and authentication.
///
/// A simple [Middleware] can be created using [createMiddleware].
typedef Client Middleware(Client inner);

/// Creates a [Middleware] using the provided functions.
///
/// If provided, [requestHandler] receives a [Request]. It replies to the
/// request by returning a [Future<Request>]. The modified [Request] is then
/// sent to the inner [Client].
///
/// If provided, [responseHandler] is called with the [Response] generated
/// by the inner [Client]. It replies to the response by returning a
/// [Future<Response]. The modified [Response] is then returned.
///
/// If provided, [onClose] will be invoked when the [Client.close] method is
/// called. Any cleanup of resources should happen at this point.
///
/// If provided, [errorHandler] receives errors thrown by the inner handler. It
/// does not receive errors thrown by [requestHandler] or [responseHandler].
/// It can either return a new response or throw an error.
